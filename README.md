# The Game 🕹️
Crack the code is a multiplayer game that you try to guess your opponent's code in less number of tries by knowing how many numbers you got correct and how many numbers are in their correct positions✅.

# Note 🗒 
**If you want a one player option or a 2 players with only one guessing you can find it on my github😺in the repo called Mind Master**
